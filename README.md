## 📄 Abstract
The **KMC School Management Portal** is a web-based platform designed to digitize and simplify communication within a school environment. The system is divided into two main modules: the **Teacher Panel** and the **Student Hub**. Teachers can upload homework, notices, and updates, while students can view real-time information, timetables, and announcements. A centralized cloud database ensures efficient, paperless, and real-time information sharing between teachers, students, and parents.

---

## ❓ Problem Statement
Traditional school communication methods such as notice boards, diaries, and verbal announcements often lead to missed information, delays, and poor record management. Schools need a centralized digital solution that provides instant access to updates and structured information management.

---

## 🏫 Existing System
- Homework written on classroom boards  
- Notices shared verbally or on paper  
- Printed timetables  
- Manual handling of parent complaints  

### Limitations of Existing System
- Time-consuming  
- Error-prone  
- No real-time updates  
- Difficult to manage and track  

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution
The **KMC School Management Portal** introduces a **role-based digital platform** where:
- Teachers have **write access** to publish homework and notices
- Students have **read-only access** to view information
- Parents can submit feedback digitally
- All data is synced through a **cloud database (Firebase)**

This ensures fast communication, transparency, and better organization.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Digitize school communication  
- Reduce paperwork  
- Provide real-time information access  
- Improve teacher–student–parent interaction  
- Maintain structured digital records
